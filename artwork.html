            Dishonored was originally set in medieval Japan, but the idea was dropped early in the game's development<br>
            because of the difficulties presented in marketing the setting, and because no member of the design team knew <br>
            much about the culture. Arkane moved the setting to London in 1666, considering that the city was <br>
            recognizable to Europeans and Americans. Later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as <br>
            floodlights, electrified barriers and 20th-century technologies that it no longer resembled London, and Arkane <br>
            opted to develop a fictional city. The city of Dunwall, designed to be a "contemporary and cool" <br>
            "period piece", was inspired by late-19th and early-20th-century London and Edinburgh. Describing why <br>
            London had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration, Smith said: <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Because it was the last year of the plague, and the year of the great fire of London, which of course ended <br>
            the plague by burning the slums down ... In this kind of game you’re always looking for a way to up the <br>
            tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren’t giant crowds of <br>
            people at the market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, and we were talking independently about <br>
            possession, and we wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you <br>
            don’t have to hide them. All these pieces just worked together. <br>
        </p>

            Music <br>
            Daniel Licht composed the game's score—an ambient, violin-heavy presentation designed to represent <br>
            19th-century London. Licht's score is crafted to evoke a sense of unsettlement, deliberately avoiding <br>
            providing comfort. Described as an "evil fog" that seamlessly fades in and out of the game without being <br>
            initiated by scripted moments, it creates an impression of ever-present danger rather than serving as a <br>
            warning for impending threats. Given Dishonored's limited cinematic scenes allowing for prolonged <br>
            interactions with specific characters, Licht faced constraints in developing character themes, leading him <br>
            to focus predominantly on composing ambient music. <br><br>
            While samples of Licht's ambient themes were incorporated into the game's scarce cinematic scenes, he was <br>
            not involved in scoring them. Licht conceived the score as a blend of older music reflecting the period <br>
            setting and 20th-century techniques, including reversed sounds. The credit song, "Honor for All," was penned <br>
            by Licht and his nephew Jon, who also provided the vocals. This song serves as a reward for players who <br>
            successfully complete the game.
