            Gameplay <br><br>
            The development team researched unexpected ways the player could combine Corvo's special powers, <br>
            such as combining a high jump with the ability to teleport in order to travel greater distances <br>
            than either ability allowed independently. Instead of restricting these exploits, the team tried <br>
            to design levels to accommodate them.[15][41] The designers did not consider all of the powers <br> 
            they conceived during development, such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls, <br>
            to be suitable for the game.[16] Some existing powers went through several revisions: a version of <br> 
            "Bend Time" caused the player to unfreeze enemies when touched; "Possession" allowed the player <br>
            to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body, but this offered less challenge. <br>
            Balancing the effectiveness of the player's powers was considered difficult. Colantonio said: <br>
            "We wanted to give [the player] very strong powers, to make [the player] really a badass, but <br>
            at the same time we didn't want the game to be too easy". Each power has a duration, mana <br>
            cost, and other variable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most <br>
            destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting the time they remain active. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Stealth <br><br>
            Dishonored's stealth system was originally based on that of the Thief series, <br>
            which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect <br>
            the player character's presence. However, it was decided that it was unrealistic <br>
            that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and  <br>
            not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the <br>
            designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the <br>
            ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to <br>
            the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single  <br>
            area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be <br>
            short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the  <br>
            character who is speaking.
